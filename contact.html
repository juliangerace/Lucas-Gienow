            <br>With powerfully clear tenor vocals and a variety of instruments at his disposal, Lucas Gienow is an experienced professional musician who is passionate about bringing the energy and excitement of Pop radio into whatever venue he performs at. Lucas has been performing consistently with great regard from the public since his days as a student at LVC, including notable appearances in festivals, on Philly radio stations and on ABC 27’s Good Day PA. Exciting and unpredictable, Lucas’s original releases include his band Sheridan Ave’s four song EP OUR LOVE(2013),his own electronic single LOST IN THE CITY(2015),and many more songs that showcase his ability to pull ideas from different genres to create his own unique sound.
            <br>
            <br><img src="images/guitarsmall.jpg" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;" >Lucas jumps from his piano to his guitar, bringing his live shows to life by reaching out to audience members of all ages with his diverse song catalogue. Lovers of Billy Joel and Jason Mraz, Elvis Presley and Coldplay find themselves tapping their feet to catchy and popular songs of today and yesterday, ensuring that no one goes home feeling like the performance just “wasn’t for them.” Lucas can further customize his show by offering a SOLO or DUO performance, depending on the feel and size of the venue.
            <br>
            <br>As an aspiring entrepreneur, Lucas has made it his goal to gain experience in as many avenues of the music industry as possible. When he isn’t performing, Lucas’s time is either spent recording andmixing other artists as a freelance recording engineer and producer or helping to license and manage music for other artists at his internship with the international publishing company RDSD Publishing.
            <br>
            <br>Lucas has heavily invested in his equipment to ensure a successful future as a musician, including purchasing his own sound system and instrument brands such as a Nord piano and Fender and Martin guitars. Venue owners and booking agents can rest assured that no matter the situation, Lucas will be prepared to provide a professional and quality experience that is sure to get people dancing and singing along, and likely stay for a few more drinks!
